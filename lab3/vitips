You can use vi to do global search and replace.  FIrst get out of insert
mode by pressing escape.  All the really powerful vi stuff is done in edit
mode.

Let's say that I pass the ball array to many functions in a file.  I want
to swtich to passing a struct pointer

Here is an example that I want to change:
void print_ball(unsinged char bits, double ball[])

I type this into vi and press enter:

:1,$s/double ball\[\]/struct Ball *bp/gp

What's taht do?
:	talks to the line editor underneath the visual editor
1,$	tells it that I want this to apply to all lines between line 1 and
	the very last line ($ is the last line).
s	s is for substitute.

/string1/string2/	

	string1 gets replaced with string2.  Since [ and ] are special 
	characters, we use backslash to turn off their special meaning by
	typing \[ and \] in the strings

g	global: if this string appears more than once on a line, replace
	them all.

p	print - tell me what the results were.

What do I get?
void print_ball(unsinged char bits, struct Ball *bp)

I get that substitution on every line in the file.

Another one is:

:1,$s/ball\[X\]/bp->X/gp

That turns this fragment:
    bits, ball[X], ball[Y], ball[VX], ball[VY] );
into:
    bits, bp->X, ball[Y], ball[VX], ball[VY] );


You could about 5 or so sommands like this to transform a lab 2 file into a
lab 3 file.
